Current shortcomings of the project:

Process creation rejected, when not enough memory. Need to implement techniques to handle this.
A rough idea in mind:
Implment the use of virtual memory. Replace the least frequently used pcb to virtual memory.
This will help in reducing the chance of process creation rejection.
Also, implement a mechanism to handle memory fragmentation.

how can different process scheduling algorithms use least frequently used technique of allocating and deallocating memory to make room for new processes?
